This has all the files needed to install the background music script with added overlays!
I will try to work on a bash script to automatically do this stuff.

You will need to do "sudo apt-get install python-pygame imagemagick" to install the needed software.

Place pngview in /usr/local/bin/


Props to Livewire for the original script: https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/347/background-music-continued-from-help-support

Special thanks to AndrewFromMelbourne for pngview: https://github.com/AndrewFromMelbourne/raspidmx
