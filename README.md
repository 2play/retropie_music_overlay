This has all the files needed to install the background music script with added overlays!
Just make the bash script executable with "sudo chmod +x BGM_Install.sh" and run it and it will do the following:

Download/install python-pygame and imagemagick.

Move pngview to the correct directory.

Create the /home/pi/BGM folder for music.


Props to Livewire for the original script: https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/347/background-music-continued-from-help-support
